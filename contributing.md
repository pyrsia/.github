# Contributing to Pyrsia

We like to pronounce it `/p…ôrsƒì…ô/` or _[ pir-see-ah ]_. :wink: [Listen to this explanation](https://youtu.be/yvFiJGMqM_Q) for more.

The following summarizes the process for contributing to the Pyrsia project.

## Code of Conduct

We follow the OpenSSF's üõ°Ô∏è (Open Source Security Foundation) [code of conduct](https://openssf.org/community/code-of-conduct/).

## Dev-flow

Pyrsia follows the ["Forking Workflow"](https://blog.devgenius.io/git-forking-workflow-bbba0226d39c). You can see GitHub's
[About collaborative development models](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model).

To contribute follow the next steps:

1. Comment in the corresponding issue that you want to contribute the package/fix proposed. If there is no open issue, we strongly suggest
   opening one to gather feedback from the team.
2. Fork the [Pyrsia repository](https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia/fork) and create a branch from the `main` branch and develop
   your fix and/or feature as discussed in previous step. See
   [About forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) for help.
3. Try to keep your branch updated with the `main` branch to avoid conflicts. See 
   [Syncing a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).
5. Please make sure to [link any related issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
   to the PR, referring to the issue of step 1.

The `pyrsia` organization maintainers will review and help with merge accepted changes.

### Pull Requests

PRs are a great way to share what you are working on and get early feedback. Make sure to open as a draft so other know the state.

When PRs are "read for review", there's a few house keeping üßπ items to keep in mind:

- Make sure to give your PRs a **great title**. These will be the commit messages and should be treated as such.
- Do _not_ worry about squashing, that is done automatically by GitHub.
- Try to avoid force pushing you branch. GitHub forces reviewers to restart since it loses their progress.
- When syncronizing your branch, prefer using merge. Check out [Syncing a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) for more details and guidance.

#### Approval Processes

All pull requests require:

- 2 approvals
- All required checks passing

### Project Board

[Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards)

All open tickets related to ongoing work are tracked in a [project board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards). 
At this time the project board is private for @pyrsia/members but feel free to open an issue if you'd like to be invited. Upcomming, future and completed work [here](https://github.com/orgs/pyrsia/projects/2).

#### Milestones

[Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)

Milestones are used to represent incremental functionality targets (this definition is subject to change as we move towards our _minimum viable product (MVP)_). These guide posts are used to help prioritize the issues and pull requests.

All pull requests are assigned to a milestone, where as issues are only assigned when they can be tracked temporally in an upcoming sprint.

#### Labels

[Learn how](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#applying-a-label)

Labels are used to sort and describe issues and pull requests. Some labels are usually reserved for one or the other, though most labels may be applied to both.

They may be used to:

- highlight the state of completion, such as "Triage" or "Blocked"
- organizing according to the source code relevant to issues or the source code changed by pull requests, such as "Blockchain", "Discovery", or "Network"

## Legal

You will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before your pull request can be accepted. This agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the source code you are submitting, and that this work is being submitted under appropriate license that we can use it.

For each pull request, all commit authors are required to sign the CLA. A copy can be found [here](https://jfrog.com/cla/). We are using [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) which requires commit email to match your GitHub account. You can view signed CLAs through their site.
