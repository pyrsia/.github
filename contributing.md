# Contributing to Pyrsia

It's pronounced `/pərsēə/` or _[ pir-see-ah ]_. :wink: [Watch this for more context](https://youtu.be/yvFiJGMqM_Q).

The following summarizes the process for contributing to the Pyrsia project.

## Code of Conduct

We follow the OpenSSF's (Open Source Security Foundation) [code of conduct](https://openssf.org/community/code-of-conduct/)

## Dev-flow and Pull Requests

Pyrsia follows the ["Forking Workflow"](https://blog.devgenius.io/git-forking-workflow-bbba0226d39c). You can see GitHub's
[About collaborative development models](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model).

To contribute follow the next steps:

1. Comment in the corresponding issue that you want to contribute the package/fix proposed. If there is no open issue, we strongly suggest
   to open one to gather feedback.
2. Fork the [Pyrsia repository](https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia-sandbox) and create a branch from the `main` branch and develop
   your fix and/or feature as discussed in previous step. See
   [About forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks).
3. Try to keep your branch updated with the `main` branch to avoid conflicts. See [Syncing a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).
4. Please make sure to [link any pull requests related to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
   , referring to the issue of step 1.

The `pyrsia` organization maintainers will review and help with merge accepted changes.

### Project Board

All open tickets related to ongoing work are tracked in a [project board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards).
You can see upcomming, future and completed work [here](https://github.com/orgs/pyrsia/projects/2).

### Pull Request Approval

All pull requests require:

- 2 approvals
- All required checks passing

### Milestones

[Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)

Milestones are used to represent incremental functionality targets (this definition is subject to change as we move towards our _minimum viable product (MVP)_). These guide posts are used to help prioritize the issues and pull requests.

All pull requests are assigned to a milestone, where as issues are only assigned when they can be tracked temporally in an upcoming sprint.

### Labels

[Learn how](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#applying-a-label)

Labels are used to sort and describe issues and pull requests. Some labels are usually reserved for one or the other, though most labels may be applied to both.

They may be used to:

- highlight the state of completion, such as "In Review" or "Blocked"
- organizing according to the source code relevant to issues or the source code changed by pull requests, such as "Blockchain", "Discovery", or "Transport"

## Legal

You will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before your pull request can be accepted. This agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the source code you are submitting, and that this work is being submitted under appropriate license that we can use it.

You can complete the CLA by going through the steps at [tbe we need a real cla](#). Once we have received the signed CLA, we'll review the request. You will only need to do this once.
